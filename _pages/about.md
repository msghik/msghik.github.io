I am Mohammad, a researcher interested in computer science. I am very fortunate to be working with Professor Hamidreza Shayegh (my advisor) and Professor Ehsan Pazouki. Before, I earned my B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from [Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training University](sru.ac.ir).

My research interests lie in the area of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Optimization.

I have experience working on:

* Medical Image Analysis
* Computer Vision in Smart Farming
